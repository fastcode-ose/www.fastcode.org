## An open-source community

Fastcode is an open-source community dedicated to advancing software performance engineering (SPE) -- making software run fast or otherwise consume few resources such as time, storage, and energy.

## Welcoming your participation

Whether you're just curious about SPE or a leading expert, Fastcode welcomes your participation. Here are some ways to [get involved](/get-involved/).

## Four pillars

Fastcode activity is loosely organized by four "pillars":
* **Technology:** improving the tools that people use for SPE
* **Research:** supporting the development of SPE as a principled scientific field
* **Education:** making it easier for instructors to teach SPE
* **Skill-building:** providing places for hands-on practicing of SPE skills.

## Managing organization

The Fastcode [managing organization](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems/about-pose) is responsible for catalyzing distributed, community-driven development and growth of the Fastcode open-source ecosystem.
