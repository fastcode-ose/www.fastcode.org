The central idea behind Fastcode is that performance and efficient use of resources must remain a core focus of computing. Achieving these goals requires advances not only in algorithm design, but also in programming models, software construction, compilers, and hardware. Progress in one of these areas often influences and reshapes the others.  

For example, a new code pattern may first appear as a hand-crafted optimization by an expert programmer, then evolve into a portable compiler transformation, and eventually inspire changes in hardware architecture or system design. Such cross-pollination drives innovation, yet opportunities for the communities to engage in joint discussion remain limited.  

The Fastcode workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore this co-evolution of algorithms, compilers, and hardware. We will focus on sharing insights across domains, identifying open problems, and fostering collaborations that advance performance engineering as a discipline.  

The workshop will be organized as a half-day event (approximately four hours). It will feature a mix of invited and contributed talks, complemented by a panel discussion. Talks will highlight recent advances as well as challenges that could shape the next generation of research. Importantly, the workshop emphasizes idea exchange rather than publication, so it does not require proceedings.  

PPoPP provides the ideal venue for this workshop. Parallel programming—the heart of PPoPP—is a driving force behind modern compiler and hardware research. Moreover, the co-location with CGO and HPCA naturally connects all three dimensions of the ecosystem that Fastcode seeks to address. We believe the workshop will be of strong interest not only to the PPoPP community but also to participants of the co-located conferences.  

# Proposed Activities

-   **Invited talks:** We will invite distinguished speakers recognized
    for high-impact contributions in algorithms, compilers, and
    hardware.

-   **Contributed talks:** We will solicit proposals from the broader
    community. Submissions will include an abstract and up to two pages
    of description. Each submission will undergo peer review, and
    accepted talks will be presented at the workshop.

-   **Panel discussion:** To conclude the workshop, we will hold a panel
    session where speakers and participants can discuss open challenges,
    research directions, and opportunities for collaboration.
