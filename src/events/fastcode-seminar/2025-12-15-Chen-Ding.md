## Abstract

Computer memory is not uniform but hierarchical, and the fast memory on most machines today is dynamically managed and shared as caches. The field of locality research is concerned with the analysis and optimization of the memory hierarchy.  Poor locality may manifest in three forms: (1) too many cache misses, (2) incomplete temporal or spatial reuse, or (3) too large working sets.

This talk will give an overview of the modern memory hierarchy and then present the Relational Theory of Locality [PACT 2013, ASPLOS 2013, TACO 2019]. It formalizes three types of measures—data movement, reuse, and working set—as mathematical and statistical functions. The key insight is that these functions are mutually convertible and therefore equivalent.   This decouples analysis from action: a Fast Coder may diagnose a problem using one measure and optimize it targeting another, free to choose the right tool for the job.
